# nya

A Shell script that wraps around to QEMU to make VMs with GPU passthrough easier

## But why?

I actually made this for a friend but probably some shmuck has no idea what to do with KVM so
I published this anyways.

## But there's other things like this already!

I don't care.

## How to use

get the rawgit for `nya` and wget it. Then mark it as a executable.

Report any issues so I can try fixing it (hopefully).
